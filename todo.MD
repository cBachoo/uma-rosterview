# TODO

update repo data with global data --> maybe change up `public/` to reflect umaguide structure
update `Upload.svelte` to point to this new github repo, and also correct upload repo

## filters:
- check if the logic is properly working, e.g is it filtering properly (looking at parents/gps or just only parents)

## harder:
- whites: add option for filter logic to be AND or OR (currently just AND)
- whites pt2: add highlighting logic to highlight selected filter skills with a gold-bg or something
- race whites: add? or no?

## endgame:
generate sharable link so others can view x user's sparks
(convert uploaded data.json into some sort of compressed link that the site can read?)

### rating
generic lineage rater (g1 wins/list of skills/star amount)
track specific rater (e.g uma stan higher bias for long races)
